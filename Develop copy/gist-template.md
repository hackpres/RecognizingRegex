# RecognizingRegex

RecognizingRegex aims to remove the frustration of regular expressions. The first time anyone sees a regex(regular expression) it's usually quite intimidating. However, what may initially seem like a series of unrelated alphanumeric characters, in a nonsensical format, is actually quite useful for developers. Here in this tutorial I will walk you through a single expression, but I aim to leave you with the tools necessary to tackle whatever regex you may encounter. Without further ado, Lets dive in!

## Summary
